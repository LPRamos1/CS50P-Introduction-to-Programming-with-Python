# Week 3 - Exceptions

This week focuses on making programs more robust by handling runtime errors and validating user input through `try`, `except`, `else`, and `pass` blocks.

* **`fuel.py`**: A fuel gauge monitoring script that calculates percentages while handling `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError` to ensure continuous execution.
* **`taqueria.py`**: An interactive ordering system using `EOFError` handling to allow users to place orders until they signal the end of input.
* **`grocery.py`**: A list management tool that counts and sorts items, demonstrating dictionary key handling and input termination.
* **`outdated.py`**: A date-parsing script that converts various date formats, utilizing string parsing and validation logic.
